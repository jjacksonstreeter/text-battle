This portfolio page showcases a playable Streamlit app with a **Top 10 scoreboard**.

- Play the game (live): *(add your Streamlit Cloud URL here after deployment)*
- Source code: [`app.py`](../app.py)
- Repo: [https://github.com/jjacksonstreeter/text-battle](https://github.com/jjacksonstreeter/text-battle)

## Scoreboard
When you save your score at the end of a game, a CSV is generated at `docs/demo/scoreboard.csv`.
You can download it directly from the app.
